# H2-Responsive-Portfolio
  This is my 2nd homework assignment for the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap-CSS framework.
  
  ## Homework Guidelines
    1. We had to create the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html`.
    2. Using Bootstrap, we had to include:
          * A navbar, which had to be consistant on every page, and include links to "home", "about me/bio", and "portfolio", and "contact" pages.
          * grid system for displaying portfolio.
    3. The website had to be fully functional (as far as front end).
    4. We had to use an HTML validation service (I used Freeformatter.com).
    5. The portfolio had to be mobile-responsive as far as images and layout.
    6. Another important part of this assignment was to practice/get used to making single-purpose commits to Github. The amount of commits I made for 
       this project is significantly higher than my previous assignment, and I have definitely learned the benefits of doing so.
       
 ## Motivation
    In addition to being a required homework assignment, part of my motivation was to learn how to do this for myself. Being that I am an artist, and want to display my artwork. In the past, I had to rely on websites like Wix or Squarespace. I love that now I can do this for myself, rather than relying on a template created by somebody else. In addition, I can now build a portfolio again (or add to this one) for displaying my future coding/web design projects.
 
 ## Programming Languages Used:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    
 ## Other Services used:
    * Bootstrap
    * Freeformatter.com (HTML validation service)
    * Github (obviously) 
    
## Freeformatter.com HTML Validation Results.
   I uploaded each of my html files into the website. Being that I'm a beginner and have never used a site like this, I must admit I was nervous. I was really happy 
   to see the results. 
   
    1. `index.html`: '<section class="main">' lacks heading. Ex. '<h1>'. This particular section only contained an image, which was the main image of my website.
    I chose to ignore this as I did not see how an <h1> would be appropriate.
    
    2. `portfolio.html`: Change name of Assets/Sum of Its Parts. The reason given, was that the file name contained spaces. While I had no issues at the time, I realize
    that I would have run into some down the road (possibly when deploying to Github). This info was really helpful.
    
    3. `contact.html`: This page turned up no issues. I believe it actually said "Valid" and "Good job!", which made me smile.
    
## Images of Website- I have also included images of what they look like when viewed on smaller devices.
